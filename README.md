### The New Year Countdown Mechanics



New Year Countdown follows the mechanics of sexagesimal-based system and counting towards the next year. Its automatic alignment allows the content to hinge an alignment of its structure rather than static alignment. Its structural appearances are inspired from a led-segment display, with the dot–instead of colon–is utilised to reduce clutters in a countdown system.



The countdown structure has a simple glow animation (demands GPU process) when it approaches on a final tick to the new year.
